# Kubemate — Kubernetes DevOps Chatbot & Log Anomaly Detector

## Overview

Kubemate is a **Flask-based AI-powered chatbot** designed for Kubernetes DevOps practitioners to analyze logs, YAMLs, Dockerfiles, and provide troubleshooting insights using Google Gemini via LangChain. It also includes a simple anomaly detection capability for logs.

This project demonstrates a full DevOps workflow:

* **Local development** with Python and Flask
* **Containerization** with Docker
* **Cloud deployment** on AWS Elastic Beanstalk with Docker support
* Environment variable management
* Session-based multi-turn chat memory

---

## Features

* Paste logs or upload files (log, YAML, Dockerfile) to analyze
* Uses Google Gemini LLM through LangChain for context-aware DevOps assistance
* Maintains chat history per session
* Clear chat history button
* Containerized for easy deployment
* Deployable to AWS Elastic Beanstalk with Docker
* Basic anomaly detection on logs (can be extended)

---

## Prerequisites

* Python 3.10+
* Docker installed
* AWS CLI installed and configured
* EB CLI installed (`pip install awsebcli`)
* AWS Account (Free tier supported)
* `.env` file containing:

  ```
  GEMINI_API_KEY=your_google_gemini_api_key_here
  ```

---

## Local Setup

### 1. Clone repo and install dependencies

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/kubemate.git
cd kubemate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Run locally

```bash
python main.py
```

Access the app: [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)

---

## Docker

### 1. Build Docker image

```bash
docker build -t kubemate .
```

### 2. Run Docker container

```bash
docker run -p 5000:5000 kubemate
```

Open [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)

---

## AWS Elastic Beanstalk Deployment

### Step 1: Initialize EB Application

```bash
eb init
```

* Select your region
* Choose existing app or create new
* Platform: **Docker running on 64bit Amazon Linux 2023**
* SSH setup: optional

---

### Step 2: Create EB Environment

```bash
eb create kubemate-env
```

---

### Step 3: Set Environment Variables

Set your Gemini API key:

Via AWS CLI:

```bash
aws elasticbeanstalk update-environment \
  --environment-name kubemate-env \
  --option-settings Namespace=aws:elasticbeanstalk:application:environment,OptionName=GEMINI_API_KEY,Value=your_api_key_here \
  --region your_aws_region
```

Or via AWS Console:
Elastic Beanstalk → kubemate-env → Configuration → Software → Environment Properties

---

### Step 4: Deploy Application

```bash
eb deploy
```

---

### Step 5: Open Application in Browser

```bash
eb open
```

---

### Step 6: View Logs (Optional)

```bash
eb logs
```

---

### Step 7: Terminate Environment (when done)

To stop all resources and avoid charges:

```bash
eb terminate kubemate-env
```

To remove application and all environments entirely:

```bash
eb terminate kubemate-env --all
```

---

## Additional Tips

* Add a `/health` route in Flask for Elastic Beanstalk health checks:

```python
@app.route("/health")
def health():
    return "OK", 200
```

* Make sure your `Dockerfile` is correctly formatted:

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.10-slim

WORKDIR /app

COPY requirements.txt .

RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

COPY . .

EXPOSE 5000

CMD ["python3", "main.py"]
```

* For multi-turn chat persistence, Flask sessions are used; no external DB required.
